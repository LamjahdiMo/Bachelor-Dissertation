## 📌 Introduction

This is **not** merely a defense of a simple method — it is a defense of a **real method** that **nobody has thought of before**. It is the story of 8 years of hard work, hardship, and suffering.

Some detractors claim the method is only practical for “tiny systems” of 2x2 or 3x3. But this is a misunderstanding:

- All **physical real-time systems** — such as robotics, control systems, and electrical circuits — primarily rely on **2x2 and 3x3 linear systems**.
- Complex, larger systems or AI/ML techniques are used for **offline time series prediction** and are **not suitable for real-time applications**.
- My method focuses on **fast, real-time problem solving** with small matrix systems.

After I published this method, I discovered a disturbing trend: **digital records are being rewritten to manipulate historical credit**.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Discovery #1: Conflicting Page Modification Dates

By inspecting website data through browser **DevTools**, I found glaring discrepancies between displayed and actual modification dates:

### Spektrum Profile  
- URL: `https://www.spektrum.de/profil/strick/heinz-klaus/1160793`  
- On-page date: `01.01.2019`  
- Actual Last Modified (from HTTP headers): `Mon, 17 Feb 2025 21:10:15 GMT`

The page **claims to be from 2019**, but was **actually modified in 2025**.

### Royal Society Page  
- Last Modified: `Wed, 02 Jul 2025 02:00:50 GMT`

All these pages were updated **after** I submitted and published my method, suggesting possible **retroactive editing to create a false historical narrative**.

---

## 🧟‍♂️ Discovery #2: Dead or Useless Wikipedia Citations

Wikipedia references for the scientist contain problematic links:

- `https://www.e-rara.ch/zut/content/pageview/3863508`: This link provides **no real biographical or historical information**.
- `https://www.ville-ge.ch/mhs/pdf/expo_2012_rousseau_livret.pdf`: This PDF is **no longer available**; it is a **dead link** cited as a reference.

---

## 🌀 Discovery #3: Circular Citation in the Swiss National Library

The Swiss National Library entry ostensibly verifies the scientist’s identity:

- Entry number: `11670912X` — notice the repeated "116" and "2X", echoing the awkward numbering pattern seen in Spektrum’s profile (`.../1160793`).
- This entry **refers back to Wikipedia**, creating a circular reference with no external verification.

This pattern extends to the Royal Society website as well, indicating a lack of **independent, credible sources** validating the method or scientist.

---

## ⚗️ Discovery #4: Absence of the Method in Scientific Literature

Despite the significance of solving 2x2 and 3x3 linear systems in real-time systems, **there is no mention of this method in any authoritative scientific archives or academic publications**, including the Royal Society.

Meanwhile, my method was:

- Submitted **first**
- Published **publicly**
- Specifically designed for **real-time applications**

---

## ⏳ Discovery #5: Timeline Evidence — Updates Postdate My Work

| Source             | Last Modified Date                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Spektrum.de        | Mon, 17 Feb 2025 21:10:15 GMT   |
| Royal Society Page | Wed, 02 Jul 2025 02:00:50 GMT   |

All these updates occurred **after** my method’s publication, raising serious concerns that the profiles and references were created or edited to **reassign credit retroactively**.

---

## 🧾 Discovery #6: Awkward Timing of the SSL Certificate Creation

A key academic reference associated with the **University of St Andrews** exhibits suspicious timing:

- The **SSL certificate** for the relevant domain was issued **only recently** — **after** my method had been published.
- SSL certificates have exact timestamps, verifiable through tools like [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) or browser DevTools.
- This indicates the page or domain may have been **created or significantly revised post-publication**, yet presented as longstanding.

This matches the pattern of **falsified modification dates and dead citations**, pointing to **retroactive construction of credibility**.

---

## 🧩 Discovery #7: The McTutor Archive Exploitation, Date Discrepancy, and Name Confusion

The **McTutor Mathematical Archive** presents a striking case of exploitation and manipulation:

- The site prominently claims its **last update was in 2000**.
- However, **DevTools inspection reveals actual last modification dates in 2025**, years after the claimed date — indicating undisclosed content updates.
- McTutor also references famous mathematicians such as **Bernoulli**, whose method I used in my thesis to approximate unsolvable linear equations, and **D’Alembert**, whose equation I used to approximate mechanical system differential equations.
- The archive states affiliation with **St Andrews University**, which correlates with the awkward SSL certificate timing and creates an aura of academic legitimacy.
- There is an **awkward (Character and Spelling) confusion involving my last name**, which seems intended to conflate or blur authorship and possibly shift credit or responsibility.
- This fits a broader pattern of **retroactive editing and manipulation of historical attribution while maintaining a false appearance of longstanding authority**.

---

## ⚖️ Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Under **GDPR and EU Cookie Law**, websites are legally required to:
  - Declare truthful timestamps
  - Disclose content updates clearly
  - Avoid misleading users about data changes

- Scientific websites, especially those about history, must maintain **integrity, transparency, and honesty**.
- Silent or false timestamps without disclaimers constitute **misleading manipulation**.

## 📉 Summary of Findings

| Claim | Reality |
|-|-|
| The scientist invented a unique linear solving method | No valid academic record exists |
| Wikipedia citations support the claim | Links are dead, broken, or circular |
| Swiss National Library verifies identity | Entry loops back to Wikipedia |
| Royal Society confirms the method | No mention of such a method found | circular Links |
| Real-time systems need large matrices | False; mostly 2x2 or 3x3 matrices are used |
| On-page dates are original | All pages updated **after** my publication |
| SSL certificate is longstanding | Certificate issued **post-publication** |
| McTutor archive last updated in 2000 | Actual modification in 2025, plus name confusion, plus misleading association with St Andrews University |

## 🚨 Conclusion

This is not mere oversight or sloppy editing — it is a **deliberate manipulation of historical and scientific records** to:

- Rewrite history after the fact
- Fabricate academic credibility through falsified citations and timestamps
- Undermine original, genuine work like mine by planting false timelines

The integrity of science hinges on **truthful attribution** and **transparent documentation**. This post stands not only as a defense of my method but as a firm **stand against digital manipulation of truth**.

---

## 🛠️ What You Can Do

- Use browser **DevTools** to inspect page modification headers  
- Verify all citations, especially on Wikipedia and academic pages  
- Question on-page dates that contradict HTTP header data  
- Speak out against inconsistencies and manipulation  

The web’s memory depends on careful inspection and vigilance.
