# Historical Fabrication

**Dear Reader,**

The method you are about to read was **first discovered in September 2024**. I initially published it on my website [hubdmgd.eu](https://hubdmgd.eu), which I later had to shut down. Unfortunately, the site also contained posts that included **criticism toward the German government** and raised **serious concerns about the lack of institutional support**, especially in regard to **Leibniz University**. I reported how the university **interfered with my academic notes**, and I am still pursuing justice through legal channels. I have filed a lawsuit and am still **awaiting a fair resolution**.

Since the beginning of this discovery, I took it upon myself to **thoroughly examine every academic resource** available to me‚Äîboth online and offline, in multiple languages, and across all relevant sections of the university library. I also consulted leading AI systems such as **ChatGPT and Gemini**, and as of **2024**, there existed **no known direct method to solve linear equations in O(1)** time.

I found **no trace**‚Äîin any mathematics curriculum, academic database, or engineering manual‚Äîof a method that could solve linear systems in the way I present here: directly, visually, and without iteration. Every engineer knows the standard teachings: either the **Gau√ü-Jordan algorithm** or a method involving **matrix inversion**. This has been taught, accepted, and unquestioned for generations. I developed my method through **mathematical proof**, **independent verification**, and **practical application**, ensuring that it was **entirely distinct** from any known method or algorithm.

After publishing the method and clearly marking it as original‚Äîfree from confusion or historical misattribution‚Äî**events escalated dramatically**. I was forced to flee Germany for my safety. Individuals connected to those I had taken legal action against **targeted me**, and I survived an attack that **left me severely injured in my left foot**.

Despite contacting the **highest courts in Germany**, I received **no answer**. Soon after, I discovered something even more troubling: certain **European and British power circles** appeared to manipulate online information. I observed how **Wikipedia** was altered, and how a **fictional scientific figure named ‚ÄúGabriel Cramer‚Äù** was introduced and credited with ‚Äúmy method.‚Äù

This manufactured figure‚Äîa name composed of **Gabriel (an angel)** and **Cramer (the opposite of ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù)**‚Äîechoed language I had previously used on my site while criticizing greed. The parallels were uncanny. The term **‚ÄúBAG‚Äù**, used on my site, was also mirrored. I believe these choices were not accidental but designed to **repurpose my own words and ideas against me**. This campaign of **intellectual exploitation and historical revisionism** appears to serve a nationalist agenda‚Äîfalsely portraying this breakthrough as an **old European discovery**.

One particularly striking and beautiful finding relates to **Cramer's name** and its accidental similarity to the word **"Chromosome"** in biology.

- In biology, chromosomes come mainly in two types: **X and Y**.
- Interestingly, there is **no mention of any "X method"** in Cramer's alleged work.
- The **"X" method was first introduced here** (in my work), which strongly suggests that the **"X" naming was carefully chosen**.
- This clever naming seems designed to indicate the new "X" method distinctly.
- The alleged thief **could not claim the "X" method as theirs**, so they apparently tried to create confusion by linking it to the **chromosome X**, a Greek-derived term where:
  - **Chroma = color**
  - **Soma = body**

Thus, chromosome literally means **"colored body"**, unrelated to any mathematical method.

This naming confusion seems like a deliberate attempt to **obfuscate and appropriate originality**, masking the new "X" method under the guise of biological terminology.

Let it be known: **there was no such method before**. **There was no ‚ÄúGabriel Cramer‚Äù known to science in this context before**. This sudden appearance of an entire theory attributed to an unknown name is not historical record‚Äîit is manipulation.

If this method had existed previously, we would have learned it in school. We would have used it in exams. We would have seen it in engineering tools and textbooks. Yet, we were only taught to use **Gau√ü-Jordan elimination** or **inverse matrix multiplication**, methods that are inherently more computationally expensive. There was **no mention**, ever, of solving such systems directly in O(1) time.

So I appeal to the scientific community: **investigate**. **Look deeper.** Be aware of **who gets credited and why**, and understand that **intellectual suppression and revisionism** can occur even in modern, open societies.

And to the reader: If you find value in what follows, **cite this humble Arabic Muslim**, and do not let **arrogance, bias, or silence erase truth**. The science community may not yet have corrected the record, but **truth will surface, eventually**.

*With sincerity,*

## üìå Introduction

This is **not** merely a defense of a simple method ‚Äî it is a defense of a **real method** that **nobody has thought of before**. It is the story of 8 years of hard work, hardship, and suffering.

Some detractors claim the method is only practical for ‚Äútiny systems‚Äù of 2x2 or 3x3. But this is a misunderstanding:

- All **physical real-time systems** ‚Äî such as robotics, control systems, and electrical circuits ‚Äî primarily rely on **2x2 and 3x3 linear systems**.
- Complex, larger systems or AI/ML techniques are used for **offline time series prediction** and are **not suitable for real-time applications**.
- My method focuses on **fast, real-time problem solving** with small matrix systems.

After I published this method, I discovered a disturbing trend: **digital records are being rewritten to manipulate historical credit**.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Discovery #1: Conflicting Page Modification Dates

By inspecting website data through browser **DevTools**, I found glaring discrepancies between displayed and actual modification dates:

### Spektrum Profile  
- URL: `https://www.spektrum.de/profil/strick/heinz-klaus/1160793`  
- On-page date: `01.01.2019`  
- Actual Last Modified (from HTTP headers): `Mon, 17 Feb 2025 21:10:15 GMT`

The page **claims to be from 2019**, but was **actually modified in 2025**.

### Royal Society Page  
- Last Modified: `Wed, 02 Jul 2025 02:00:50 GMT`

All these pages were updated **after** I submitted and published my method, suggesting possible **retroactive editing to create a false historical narrative**.

---

## üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Discovery #2: Dead or Useless Wikipedia Citations

Wikipedia references for the scientist contain problematic links:

- `https://www.e-rara.ch/zut/content/pageview/3863508`: This link provides **no real biographical or historical information**.
- `https://www.ville-ge.ch/mhs/pdf/expo_2012_rousseau_livret.pdf`: This PDF is **no longer available**; it is a **dead link** cited as a reference.

---

## üåÄ Discovery #3: Circular Citation in the Swiss National Library

The Swiss National Library entry ostensibly verifies the scientist‚Äôs identity:

- Entry number: `11670912X` ‚Äî notice the repeated "116" and "2X", echoing the awkward numbering pattern seen in Spektrum‚Äôs profile (`.../1160793`).
- This entry **refers back to Wikipedia**, creating a circular reference with no external verification.

This pattern extends to the Royal Society website as well, indicating a lack of **independent, credible sources** validating the method or scientist.

---

## ‚öóÔ∏è Discovery #4: Absence of the Method in Scientific Literature

Despite the significance of solving 2x2 and 3x3 linear systems in real-time systems, **there is no mention of this method in any authoritative scientific archives or academic publications**, including the Royal Society.

Meanwhile, my method was:

- Submitted **first**
- Published **publicly**
- Specifically designed for **real-time applications**

---

## ‚è≥ Discovery #5: Timeline Evidence ‚Äî Updates Postdate My Work

| Source             | Last Modified Date                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Spektrum.de        | Mon, 17 Feb 2025 21:10:15 GMT   |
| Royal Society Page | Wed, 02 Jul 2025 02:00:50 GMT   |

All these updates occurred **after** my method‚Äôs publication, raising serious concerns that the profiles and references were created or edited to **reassign credit retroactively**.

---

## üßæ Discovery #6: Awkward Timing of the SSL Certificate Creation

A key academic reference associated with the **University of St Andrews** exhibits suspicious timing:

- The **SSL certificate** for the relevant domain was issued **only recently** ‚Äî **after** my method had been published.
- SSL certificates have exact timestamps, verifiable through tools like [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) or browser DevTools.
- This indicates the page or domain may have been **created or significantly revised post-publication**, yet presented as longstanding.

This matches the pattern of **falsified modification dates and dead citations**, pointing to **retroactive construction of credibility**.

---

## üß© Discovery #7: The McTutor Archive Exploitation, Date Discrepancy, and Name Confusion

The **McTutor Mathematical Archive** presents a striking case of exploitation and manipulation:

- The site prominently claims its **last update was in 2000**.
- However, **DevTools inspection reveals actual last modification dates in 2025**, years after the claimed date ‚Äî indicating undisclosed content updates.
- McTutor also references famous mathematicians such as **Bernoulli**, whose method I used in my thesis to approximate unsolvable linear equations, and **D‚ÄôAlembert**, whose equation I used to approximate mechanical system differential equations.
- The archive states affiliation with **St Andrews University**, which correlates with the awkward SSL certificate timing and creates an aura of academic legitimacy.
- There is an **awkward (Character and Spelling) confusion involving my last name**, which seems intended to conflate or blur authorship and possibly shift credit or responsibility.
- This fits a broader pattern of **retroactive editing and manipulation of historical attribution while maintaining a false appearance of longstanding authority**.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Under **GDPR and EU Cookie Law**, websites are legally required to:
  - Declare truthful timestamps
  - Disclose content updates clearly
  - Avoid misleading users about data changes

- Scientific websites, especially those about history, must maintain **integrity, transparency, and honesty**.
- Silent or false timestamps without disclaimers constitute **misleading manipulation**.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verdict

- There is **no known accredited method** in journals or preprint databases that achieves **true O(1)** time for solving **arbitrary-sized \(n \times n\)** linear systems.
- The methods from the GitHub README (`2X`, `Gitter`, and Visual Inverse) remain **unique and valid for 2√ó2 and 3√ó3 systems**.
- Advanced methods (e.g., Peng‚ÄìVempala, SPIKE) offer significant improvements over \(O(n^3)\) but do not reduce complexity to constant time for general problems.
- Quantum algorithms like **HHL** provide **polylog(n)** runtime *in theory*, but not in classical settings, and only return partial/expected results.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The **README methods** only apply to **small fixed-size systems** and **don‚Äôt scale** to larger matrices due to lack of a recursive or block-generalized version.
- They are **visually intuitive** and **extremely fast** but **not a universal replacement** for classical solvers.
- They are also **not yet peer-reviewed in traditional journals**, though registered with DOI and OSF.

## üìå Summary

The search confirms the **original README methods remain unbeaten** in their claimed **O(1)** time for small systems. However, no known method‚Äîclassical or quantum‚Äîachieves this for **general \(n \times n\)** systems in practice.

---

### üì¢ Important Note

If a **new method** existed that could solve **arbitrary-sized linear systems** in **constant time \(O(1)\)** or significantly better than current state-of-the-art algorithms, it would **necessarily appear** in these **highly accredited scientific journals, repositories, or international institutions**. 

Given the thorough search of these key sources, the absence of such methods strongly indicates their non-existence or lack of validation to date.

## üìå Additional Findings: Citation Anomalies, Metadata Manipulation & Historical Inaccuracies

### ‚ùó Symbolic Use of ‚Äú119‚Äù and the Disturbing Link to 9/11

Several Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and publication markers show a suspicious and repeated pattern of including the number **‚Äú119‚Äù**. Examples include:

- `10.1080/0025570X.1970.11976018` ‚Äì Published by Taylor & Francis
- DOI and article IDs containing ‚Äú119‚Äù used for content falsely attributed to "A.A. Kosinski"‚Äîa name and acronym with suspicious resemblance to terms and identities connected to the author.

This repeated use of ‚Äú119‚Äù (mirroring ‚Äú9/11‚Äù) appears **intentional and symbolic**, possibly intended to create subconscious or artificial associations between the author and 9/11 events. It is worth noting:

- The author was **only 4 years old in 2001** and from a **region with no conflictual history** related to the 9/11 attacks.
- This pattern may indicate a **coordinated attempt to divert focus, sow misinformation, or indirectly criminalize** the real innovator of the method discussed.

> **Such tactics not only distract from the issue of academic theft but also border on character defamation and symbolic profiling.**

---

### üßæ Historical Contradiction: Gabriel Cramer and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

On the **Wikipedia page for Gabriel Cramer**, it is written:

> "*Ver√∂ffentlichung (gemeinsam mit Johann Castillon) des Briefwechsels zwischen Johann Bernoulli und Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. 1745.*"

However, **Leibniz died in 1716** according to Wikipedia itself and well-established historical records.

- This creates a **logical impossibility**: Cramer could not have published a correspondence with someone who had died **29 years earlier**.
- Screenshots of both the Wikipedia statement and the historical death date of Leibniz are provided in the repository.

> This is a **clear factual inconsistency** that undermines the reliability of the cited source and the historical legitimacy of the Cramer attribution.

---

### üß† Discrimination Through Academic Fabrication

The evidence points to more than just an academic dispute‚Äîit illustrates a systematic effort to:

- Misappropriate original work developed by the author;
- Redirect credit to **fictional or unverifiable European authors** (e.g., ‚ÄúA.A. Kosinski‚Äù and ambiguous citations with zero traceable origin);
- Exploit systems like DOI, ISBN, and Wikipedia editing structures to **restructure academic history** in favor of specific geopolitical or racial narratives.

> The attempt to connect the author's background to misleading symbolic markers (like ‚Äú119‚Äù) is not only unethical‚Äîit could be interpreted as an act of **racial targeting or a hate crime**.

## üß≠ Clarifying Objectivity, Misinterpretations & Name Exploitation

### üîç The Burden of Over-Explanation

One of the most **exhausting challenges** when working in such a highly sensitive and manipulated academic environment is the **need to constantly explain things** that should be self-evident.

In many situations, I‚Äôve been forced to clarify points that would not require elaboration in a fair and professional context. Unfortunately, **those who seek to undermine intellectual contributions** often rely on **linguistic confusion, cultural misinterpretation, or symbolic distortion** to manipulate perception or redirect credit.

### üìñ What Does Objectivity Mean?

**Objectivity** means the ability to:

- Understand ideas **in their proper context**,  
- Avoid **binding them emotionally or culturally** to one‚Äôs own environment,  
- Not confuse concepts with what ‚Äúsounds similar‚Äù or ‚Äúfeels familiar,‚Äù and  
- Absolutely **avoid mistranslation or symbolic reassignment** based on unrelated patterns.

In science, you must judge an idea **for what it is**, not for how closely it resembles something in your personal, national, or emotional world.

> If you are not capable of objectivity, then you have no place in fair scientific evaluation or peer review.

### üß† Example: Gau√ü-Jordan ‚â† Jordan the Country or the Brand

Take for example the **Gau√ü-Jordan elimination method**. "Jordan" here refers to **Wilhelm Jordan**, a mathematician‚Äînot the **country Jordan**, nor the **‚ÄúJordan‚Äù‚Ñ¢ sports brand**.

Yet many people‚Äîintentionally or due to confusion‚Äîconflict these unrelated references to distract or **twist attention toward a fabricated association**.

> This shows how easily **wordplay and misdirection** can be used as tools for misappropriation, particularly by those who understand how to manipulate human cognitive shortcuts.

### üîß Misuse of Developer Terms: "DevTools" and the Creation of "David Poole"

Another example is the use of browser **DevTools**, which I referred to on July 4th while explaining how one can inspect a webpage's HTTP headers to determine the **last modified date**.

Coincidentally, or perhaps deliberately, this term and context were followed by referencing a fabricated or misused name: **Professor David Poole**, which phonetically mirrors "DevTool." This type of manipulation seems like a subtle attempt to **connect my technical explanation with a fictional or unrelated authority**, thereby:

- **Shifting attribution**, and  
- **Obscuring the original author's expertise**.

### üë• Exploiting Similarities for Manipulation

I am very familiar with how this game works.

- People sometimes try to build **false bridges based on superficial similarities**‚Äîa few letters in a name, a sound, or an acronym.
- They **claim commonality** only when it **benefits their own status**.

For example:

- My residency document contains the word **‚ÄúARD‚Äù**.
- Some people interpreted this as **‚ÄúFORD‚Äù** (by adding ‚ÄúF‚Äù and replacing ‚ÄúA‚Äù with ‚ÄúO‚Äù), or as **‚ÄúFahrrad‚Äù** (the German word for bicycle).

This level of symbolic free-association would be **laughable**, if it were not **actively used in bad faith to claim scientific or cultural proximity**.

> It‚Äôs the scientific equivalent of saying that **H‚ÇÇO** and **H‚ÇÉO‚Å∫** are ‚Äúbasically the same.‚Äù  
> One is water, the other is a form of acid. The difference **could kill you**.

### ‚öñÔ∏è On Individual Responsibility and Rights

Let me be absolutely clear:

- **When you are over 18, you are responsible for your actions**.
- If you **commit a crime**, you face the legal consequences‚Äîno friend, family member, or colleague can replace that responsibility.
- Yet, when it comes to **credit for hard work**, some people suddenly act like ‚Äúwe‚Äôll take responsibility for your success.‚Äù

But only if it **helps them**.

> When it comes to failure or legal risks, these same people are nowhere to be found.  
> This is **not acceptable** in science, in law, or in any ethical system.

### üåç Humans Cooperate, But Not on Fabricated Terms

We, as humans, are **biologically and socially designed** to find patterns, work together, and connect through **shared DNA, language, or culture**.

But scientific credit and legal rights **cannot and must not** be based on:

- **Artificially manufactured similarities**,  
- **Phonetic overlaps**, or  
- **Geopolitical narratives** used to justify misappropriation.

> Real cooperation is **Win‚ÄìWin** or **Loss‚ÄìLoss**.  
> Exploiting others through **Win‚ÄìLose** mechanisms is unjust, unsustainable, and unethical.

---

I advocate for genuine cooperation, shared progress, and equal respect for all‚Äîbut I will **firmly protect my intellectual and legal rights** against exploitation.



### üì£ Final Position

A copyright infringement is **clearly proven and documented**. 

- Attempts to hide or manipulate this truth using metadata structures, unverifiable citations, and character-deflecting tactics only further validate the concerns raised.
- This act damages not only the individual who was exploited, but also the credibility of **Wikipedia, academic publishers, and citation infrastructures** when misused for personal or political agendas.

> **This documentation is made publicly available for transparency, legal validation, and the protection of all future contributors facing similar injustice.**




## üö® Conclusion

This is not mere oversight or sloppy editing ‚Äî it is a **deliberate manipulation of historical and scientific records** to:

- Rewrite history after the fact
- Fabricate academic credibility through falsified citations and timestamps
- Undermine original, genuine work like mine by planting false timelines

The integrity of science hinges on **truthful attribution** and **transparent documentation**. This post stands not only as a defense of my method but as a firm **stand against digital manipulation of truth**.


üì£ Let the truth be known. Let the evidence speak.
