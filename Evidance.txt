## 📌 Introduction

This is **not** a defense of a mere method — it is a defense of a **real method**, one that **nobody has thought of before**.

Some may try to dismiss it, saying it's “only practical for tiny systems of 2x2 or 3x3,” but this is a gross misunderstanding of reality:

- All **physical real-time systems** — from robotics to circuits to control systems — rely on **2x2 and 3x3 linear systems**.
- You **don’t need huge matrices** to solve real-world problems.
- For **predicting time series** (like stock trends), you may need larger matrices or AI/ML techniques — but these are **offline**, **computationally expensive**, and **unsuitable for real-time systems**.

My method is not about massive data. It’s about **fast, real-time problem solving**. And now, what I discovered is that **after publishing this method**, the digital record has started to **rewrite history around it**.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Discovery #1: Conflicting Page Modification Dates

Using browser **DevTools inspection**, I examined several sources that reference the so-called scientist “Heinz Klaus.”

### 🔗 Spektrum Profile  
- **URL:** `https://www.spektrum.de/profil/strick/heinz-klaus/1160793`  
- **On-page date:** `01.01.2019`  
- **Actual Last Modified (from headers):**  
  `Mon, 17 Feb 2025 21:10:15 GMT`

This is a **clear mismatch**. The page **was modified in 2025**, yet it **claims to be from 2019**. That’s misinformation — whether intentional or not.

### 🔗 Personal Website  
- **URL:** `https://www.klausheinz.de`  
- **Last Modified:**  
  `Sat, 30 Dec 2023 18:23:41 GMT`

Again — modified **after my work was published**.

### 🔗 Royal Society Page  
- **Last Modified:**  
  `Wed, 02 Jul 2025 02:00:50 GMT`

These three websites — all **updated after** I had submitted and published my method — raise a serious question:
> Were they edited **after the fact** to **retroactively establish** credit or historical presence?

## 🧟‍♂️ Discovery #2: Dead or Useless Wikipedia Citations

Let’s examine the links used in the **Wikipedia entry** for this scientist.

### 🔗 `e-rara.ch` Source  
- **URL:** `https://www.e-rara.ch/zut/content/pageview/3863508`  
- **Observation:** Contains **no real biographical or historical data**. It **fails to support** the claim.

### 🔗 `ville-ge.ch` PDF  
- **URL:** `https://www.ville-ge.ch/mhs/pdf/expo_2012_rousseau_livret.pdf`  
- **Observation:** This **no longer exists**. A completely **dead link** is being cited as a reference.

---

## 🌀 Discovery #3: Circular Citation from the Swiss National Library

Then we reach the **Swiss National Library entry**, allegedly validating the person’s academic identity.

### 🔗 Entry Number: `11670912X`  
- **Breakdown:** Contains the repeating **"116"** — same awkward number found in Spektrum’s profile (`.../1160793`). Coincidence? Maybe. Pattern? Possibly.
- **The Most Awkward Part:** It refers **back to Wikipedia**.

This is called a **circular reference** — a system where A verifies B, and B verifies A. No external validation exists.

This number — `11670912X` — looks official, but it lacks:
- Any independent source
- Concrete references to published work
- A real academic or historical foundation

---

## ⚗️ Discovery #4: No Mention of “The Method” in Scientific Records

The claim that this person developed a method to **solve 2x2 and 3x3 systems** appears nowhere in:

- The **Royal Society archives**
- Academic publications
- Scientific proceedings

Even though **these small systems** are vital in real-time modeling, **no trace of this “method” exists** in authoritative science literature.

Meanwhile, my own method was:
- Submitted **first**
- Published **publicly**
- Designed for **real-time systems**, unlike large AI models trained offline

## ⏳ Discovery #5: Timeline Evidence — All Updates Came After My Work

To be precise:

| **Source**              | **Last Modified Date**              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Spektrum.de Profile     | Mon, 17 Feb 2025 21:10:15 GMT       |
| KlausHeinz.de           | Sat, 30 Dec 2023 18:23:41 GMT       |
| Royal Society Page      | Wed, 02 Jul 2025 02:00:50 GMT       |

My own method had already been **submitted and published before all of these**. So if someone appears to have been credited afterward, it raises a very serious question:

> **Was this profile, and its supporting network of links, created after my work to reassign credit?**

## 🧾 Legal and Ethical Dimensions

Even under **GDPR and EU Cookie Law**, websites must:
- Declare accurate timestamps
- Disclose content updates
- Be transparent about data changes

If a website pretends not to have changed since 2019 — yet was updated in 2025 — and does so **without a disclaimer**, it may be:

- In violation of transparency laws  
- Misleading users  
- Manipulating academic and public perception

When the subject is **scientific history**, the threshold for honesty is even higher. There should be **no room for silent modifications or retroactive authorship**.

## 📉 Summary: Fabrication, Not Documentation

| **Claim** | **Reality** |
|----------|-------------|
| A scientist invented a unique linear method | No academic record of this exists |
| Wikipedia supports the claim | Links are broken, dead, or circular |
| Swiss Library verifies the person | Refers back to Wikipedia |
| Royal Society confirms the method | No such method listed |
| Real-time systems use big matrices | False — they mostly use 2x2 or 3x3 |
| Page dates are original | All were modified after my work |

---

## 🚨 Conclusion: This Is Intellectual Misconduct

This is not just sloppy editing — it is **manipulation of historical and scientific records**.

- Someone is trying to **rewrite history after the fact**
- Fabricate credibility through **fake citations and modification dates**
- Undermine original work like mine by **planting false timelines**

The integrity of science depends on **truthful attribution** and **transparent documentation**.

This post is not just a defense of my method — it is a **stand against digital manipulation of truth**.

## 🛠️ What You Can Do

- Inspect page headers using browser DevTools  
- Double-check every citation, especially in Wikipedia  
- Don’t trust on-page dates without verifying HTTP headers  
- Speak out when you find inconsistencies

The web remembers — but **only if we inspect it carefully**.

📣 Let the truth speak. Let the evidence be seen.
