# Solving Linear Systems in O(1): The 2X, Matrix Inversion, and Gitter Methods

## Preface: A Note to the Reader

**Dear Reader,**

The method you are about to read was **first discovered in September 2024**. I initially published it on my website [hubdmgd.eu](https://hubdmgd.eu), which I later had to shut down. Unfortunately, the site also contained posts that included **criticism toward the German government** and raised **serious concerns about the lack of institutional support**, especially in regard to **Leibniz University**. I reported how the university **interfered with my academic notes**, and I am still pursuing justice through legal channels. I have filed a lawsuit and am still **awaiting a fair resolution**.

Since the beginning of this discovery, I took it upon myself to **thoroughly examine every academic resource** available to me‚Äîboth online and offline, in multiple languages, and across all relevant sections of the university library. I also consulted leading AI systems such as **ChatGPT and Gemini**, and as of **2024**, there existed **no known direct method to solve linear equations in O(1)** time.

I found **no trace**‚Äîin any mathematics curriculum, academic database, or engineering manual‚Äîof a method that could solve linear systems in the way I present here: directly, visually, and without iteration. Every engineer knows the standard teachings: either the **Gau√ü-Jordan algorithm** or a method involving **matrix inversion**. This has been taught, accepted, and unquestioned for generations. I developed my method through **mathematical proof**, **independent verification**, and **practical application**, ensuring that it was **entirely distinct** from any known method or algorithm.

After publishing the method and clearly marking it as original‚Äîfree from confusion or historical misattribution‚Äî**events escalated dramatically**. I was forced to flee Germany for my safety. Individuals connected to those I had taken legal action against **targeted me**, and I survived an attack that **left me severely injured in my left foot**.

Despite contacting the **highest courts in Germany**, I received **no answer**. Soon after, I discovered something even more troubling: certain **European and British power circles** appeared to manipulate online information. I observed how **Wikipedia** was altered, and how a **fictional scientific figure named ‚ÄúGabriel Cramer‚Äù** was introduced and credited with ‚Äúmy method.‚Äù

This manufactured figure‚Äîa name composed of **Gabriel (an angel)** and **Cramer (the opposite of ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù)**‚Äîechoed language I had previously used on my site while criticizing greed. The parallels were uncanny. The term **‚ÄúBAG‚Äù**, used on my site, was also mirrored. I believe these choices were not accidental but designed to **repurpose my own words and ideas against me**. This campaign of **intellectual exploitation and historical revisionism** appears to serve a nationalist agenda‚Äîfalsely portraying this breakthrough as an **old European discovery**.

Let it be known: **there was no such method before**. **There was no ‚ÄúGabriel Cramer‚Äù known to science in this context before**. This sudden appearance of an entire theory attributed to an unknown name is not historical record‚Äîit is manipulation.

If this method had existed previously, we would have learned it in school. We would have used it in exams. We would have seen it in engineering tools and textbooks. Yet, we were only taught to use **Gau√ü-Jordan elimination** or **inverse matrix multiplication**, methods that are inherently more computationally expensive. There was **no mention**, ever, of solving such systems directly in O(1) time.

So I appeal to the scientific community: **investigate**. **Look deeper.** Be aware of **who gets credited and why**, and understand that **intellectual suppression and revisionism** can occur even in modern, open societies.

And to the reader: If you find value in what follows, **cite this humble Arabic Muslim**, and do not let **arrogance, bias, or silence erase truth**. The science community may not yet have corrected the record, but **truth will surface, eventually**.

*With sincerity,*

## Introduction

For decades, Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination have stood as the standard tools for solving linear systems. These methods, though reliable, come with a price: **time**. Specifically, they involve computational complexity on the order of `O(n^3)`, which becomes a bottleneck in real-time and high-precision applications.

This post introduces and formalizes three alternative methods:

- **The 2X Method** (for 2√ó2 systems)
- **A direct constant-time Matrix Inversion**
- **The Gitter / 4X Method** (for 3√ó3 systems)

These methods claim **constant-time performance (`O(1)`)**, achieved through **visual cross-structure logic**, not row manipulation or pivoting. By replacing multi-step algorithms with single-step visual-algebraic identities, they aim to **outperform traditional methods both in speed and conceptual clarity.**

---

## 1. The 2X Method

Let us begin with a standard 2√ó2 system:

5x + 3y = 11\
2x + 2y = 6



Rewritten in augmented form:

11 | 5 3\
6  | 2 2



### X-Shape Construction

To solve for **y**, draw an **X** across the matrix:

y = (5√ó6 - 2√ó11) / (5√ó2 - 3√ó2) = 2


To solve for **x**, switch the 5 and 3 in the first row:

11 | 3 5\
6  | 2 2

x = (3√ó6 - 2√ó11) / (3√ó2 - 5√ó2) = 1


### Generalized Form

Given:

a1 x + b1 y = E1\
a2 x + b2 y = E2

Write as:

E1 | a1 b1\
E2 | a2 b2


Then:

x = (b1√óE2 - b2√óE1) / (b1√óa2 - a1√ób2)\
y = (a1√óE2 - a2√óE1) / (a1√ób2 - b1√óa2)

The X-drawing reduces the system to constant-time arithmetic‚Äîno loops, no steps, no elimination.

---

## 2. Matrix Inversion via Direct Visual Substitution

Consider:

x + 2y = A\
3x + 4y = B

Written as:

A | 1 2\
B | 3 4

Then:

x = (B - 3A) / (4 - 6) = 3A/2 - B/2

Swap top row for y:

A | 2 1\
B | 4 3

y = (2B - 4A) / (6 - 4) = -2A + B


Reconstructed inverse:

[ 3/2 -1/2 ]\
[ -2    1  ]


This offers an **explicit and instantaneous inverse**, bypassing determinant or elimination steps.

---

## 3. The Gitter (4X) Method for 3√ó3 Systems

Consider the system:

x + y + z = 6\
2x + y - z = 1\
-x + 2y + 2z = 9


Written as:

| 6 | 1 1 1 |\
| 1 | 2 1 -1 |\
| 9 | -1 2 2 |


Shift terms with x:

| 6 - x 1 1 |\
| 1 - 2x 1 -1 |\
| 9 + x 2 2 |

Draw **two intersecting Xs** (or an 8-shape). Trace the edges and substitute:

x = 1\
z = 3\
y = 2

### Why the Gitter Xs Matter

- Each diagonal represents a **multiplication rule**
- Color-coded or directional paths encode **substitution logic**
- Constant-time evaluation through a **visualized dependency map**

## Comparison Table

| Method              | Type              | Steps Involved         | Complexity |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Gauss-Jordan        | Traditional       | Elimination, pivoting    | O(n^3)      |
| Matrix Inversion    | Traditional       | Determinant + adjugate   | O(n^3)      |
| 2X Method           | Proposed (2√ó2)    | Visual cross-products    | O(1)        |
| Gitter (4X Method)  | Proposed (3√ó3)    | Double X diagram         | O(1)        |

## Conclusion

These methods do not just improve speed. They propose a **new way of thinking**‚Äîusing visual symmetries to shortcut algebraic structure. They avoid the historical constraints of computation and expose deeper patterns within linear systems.

They were not taught in universities. They were not found in search engines. They were not written by European mathematicians centuries ago. They were discovered by **a modern student under suppression**, in 2024.

If this method serves your work, **cite the author**.  
If it challenges your beliefs, **investigate it honestly**.  
And if the world has tried to bury it, **help bring it to light.**
